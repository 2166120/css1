		<h1>@ media queries</h1>
		<p>
			CSS uses the @media rule to detect information about the divice being used to access
			the website. For example, it can be used to detect the size of the device, its capabilities,
			and its orientation. For this course, we will be using it to detect the device size, but keep
			in mind that it is capable of much more.
