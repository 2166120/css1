                <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object oriented scripted language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and
                    lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host
                    environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over
                    them.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span class="about">Variable Declaration</span> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee,
                        a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span>var x;</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="about">Variable Assignment</span> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our
                        variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span>var x = 10;</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="about">Data Types</span> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span>true</span> or <span>false;</span> null - <span>null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span>42</span> or <span>3.14159;</span> String - <span>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span>
                        Array - <span>[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span>{first_name:'Jane',last_name:'Doe'}</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="about">Conditionals</span> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on
                        values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following
                        conditional statements: <span>if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span>else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first
                        condition is false; <span>else</span> we execute this block of code;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="about">Loops</span> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat
                        an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="about">Function</span> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of
                        instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we
                        screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more
                        tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.
                    </li>
